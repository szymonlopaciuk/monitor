# Monitor: an e-Paper smart display script

This is a script that runs on a Raspberry Pi equipped with a Waveshare 7.5B
e-Paper display. Given a name of the stop (currently supports only the stops
available on the [transport.opendata.swiss](transport.opendata.swiss) API), it 
will display the next departures from that stop, as well as the current weather
conditions in the area. The weather is fetched using the [open-meteo.com](open-meteo.com)
API.

No doubt the code can be adapted to other e-Paper displays, but I have not
done so.

## Installation and usage

The script can be installed using poetry simply by running `poetry install`.

The script can be run using `poetry run monitor run`:

```
Usage: monitor run [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -o, --output [pil|epd]   How to display the image.
  -f, --flip               If set, the image will be rotated by 180Â°.
  -t, --transit-stop TEXT  Name of the public transport stop or station to
                           monitor.  [required]
  -d, --delay INTEGER      Delay in seconds before refreshing the display.
                           Zero value means the display will only be refreshed
                           once, after which the program will exit.
  --help                   Show this message and exit.
```

The option `--output` can be used to specify how the image should be displayed.
The default is `pil`, which will display the image in a window, which is useful
for debugging. The other option is `epd`, which will display the image on the
e-Paper display.

## Installing as a systemd service

Assuming the repo has been clone at `/home/pi/monitor`, and you have a default
installation of poetry on your system, you can simply copy the `monitor.service`
file to `/etc/systemd/system/` and enable the service:

```
sudo cp /home/pi/monitor/monitor.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable monitor.service
sudo systemctl start monitor.service
```

In case of a different setup you will need to edit the service file. If you
encounter errors you can check the logs using `journalctl -u monitor.service`.
